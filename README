# The FoodCraft mining expedition that has landed on the planet Banquatari to mine
# food stuffs to sell to a galaxy teaming with explorers and colonists. The mining 
# expedition is a large operation. The teams have been divided into groups:
#   Bread Miners : This group of miners have set up camp in the Wonder Valley mining bread.
#   Cheese Miners : This group of miners have set up camp in the Colby Plains and mine cheese.
#   Bologna Miners : This group of miners have set up camp in Os'cermayer Canyon and mine bologna.
#   The Foreman : This person coordinates supply drops at the central dock.
#   The Messengers : This group monitors the situation and can perform tallies and send messages
#                    to miners.
# 
# The Foreman will drop off two of the three types of supplies at the docks.
# The group of miners will try and get them from the docks and make sandwhiches for themselves 
#   to eat.
# The messangers can carry messages and supplies to the miners, but not to the foreman.
